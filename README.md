# All-Elite-Wrestling-Event-Tracker

This will poll the [AEW events page](https://www.allelitewrestling.com/aew-events) at whatever interval you schedule and build an RSS file to be used on an RSS feed reader. 

The feed is built using [rfeed.](https://github.com/svpino/rfeed)

There is an example output included in the files.
